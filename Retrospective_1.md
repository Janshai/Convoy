# What Went Well

- I found that the work required to display 2 maps on one MapView was supported by the inbuilt functions that come in the MapKit Framework apple provides. I had feared that this would be one of the more difficult aspects of the project and would involve either drawing on top of the view or digging into the underlying workings of MapKit. In fact it was fairly trivial to build a working prototype of the functionality.
- I decided on how the routing of the app was going to work. This had been a difficult thing to visualise before beginning the development, so I decided to leave the decision until I had built out the prototype functionality. I am now decided on havig 2 separate MapViews. One to handle the routing of the user that focuses only on their route and car, and one that shows the positions of all cars and routes involved in the Journey. This solves several major issues as dicussed in the design files.
- I found a useful resource that does something similar to the core functionality for routing the user and providing blow-by-blow directions. I will use this when developing that feature.

# What can  be improved

- As is evident from the timing of this retrospective, I have struggled greatly to prioritise and find time for this project amongst my other commitments. This means a lot of the work for this sprint and other sprints that are planned have not been completed. I will now have to adjust my plans and the scope of the project to meet the deadline.
- I have not been adhering fully to the Agile philosophy. Primarily I have been working towards one end product rather than designing iterative products that build upon each other but could stand alone.

# What Actions I will take

- I need to ensure that I spend adequate time on this project. This is a difficult change to make and the steps do not need to be delved into here, but it is an action point.
- I will re-plan the project to start with a minimum viable project to work towards. I think this will mean focusing on one use case, the case in which multiple users travel to one location from multiple starting points. From here I can build all of the core funtions and then start to begin on other use cases. This will be discussed in depth in design docs and the interim report.
