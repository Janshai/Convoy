# Scenarios

## Intro and motivation

Upon researching the domain area and related work I came to rhe conclusion that the best method of requirements gathering to use for this project was to design Scenarios.

THe reason I chose these

Upon brainstorming scenarios in which this app could be used I could think of three basic use cases. There are also a number of peripheral cases which I termed 'specialised scenarios'. These scenarios are not deemed within the realm of the core purpose of this app but may still be use cases the app is used frequently for, therefore they may still be worth considering when designing any solution.

The first of the primary scenarios I named "Lone Travel".

## Lone Travel

"The users are each travelling alone from different start-locations to the same destination. They may potentially have different start and arrival times, or wish to synchronise in some way."

DISCUSS

## Joint Journey

"The users are travelling from the same location to the same destination at the same time. They want to synchronise their journey, stopping at the same times, so they need a structured way to communicate these decisions without distracting themselves from the road."

DISCUSS

## Meet-In-The-Middle

"This scenario combines the previous two in that the users start at different locations but unite at some point in the middle before proceeding to the same destination, combning the needs of both previous scenarios."

DISCUSS

I have decided to create scenarios as I think this style of requirements gathering is very suitable to this project. There are three main scenarios that I envision this app being used in as well as a few other more specialised scenarios that the are not the core purpose for the app but are contexts in which users could choose to use the app and so are still worth consideration during the design phases. I will first discuss the main scenarios, then briefly mention the secondary scenarios. I will write 2 descriptions for each scenario, the first a brief quotable description, the second a more in depth discussion of the needs of a user in this use case.

## Core Scenarios

### Lone Travel
#### Brief

The users are each travelling alone from different start-locations to the same destination. They may potentially have different start and arrival times, or wish to synchronise in some way.

#### Discussion

In this scenario the users do not need to communicate or interact in a structured way such as aligning food stops, petrol levels or any other issues that may arise, though it would still be useful to handle these issues within the app to create a single journey experience, these are not hard requirements. The fundamental need is to allow the users to update each other on their progress. Has the other user set off yet? Have they arrived? When will they arrive? Have they broken down? Where are they? It might also be useful to facilitate less structured communication betwen the users such as voice chat. In addition to this the user will expect other features associated with routing apps to be replicated. Some of these may be hard requirements, such as knowing when the user can expect to arrive, adjusting routes based on traffic warnings, communicationg traffic warnings to the user, blow-by-bow instructions e.g. 'Turn right in 50 yards'.


### Joint Journey

#### Brief

The users are travelling from the same location to the same destination at the same time. They want to synchronise their journey, stopping at the same times, so they need a structured way to communicate these decisions without distracting themselves from the road.

#### Discussion

In this scenario the users journeys are synchronised, meaning they travel at the same time and they travel together. This means that they will want to communicate in a structured way to all of the other users. Do they want to stop for a break? Do they want to get food? Do they need petrol? Are they having mechanical issues? Where are you? A nother need in this scenario is the need to stick together and know where the other person is. They need to accurtely know where the other users are so they can stick together. In addition to this the user will expect other features associated with routing apps to be replicated. Some of these may be hard requirements, such as knowing when the user can expect to arrive, adjusting routes based on traffic warnings, communicationg traffic warnings to the user, blow-by-bow instructions e.g. 'Turn right in 50 yards'.

### Meet-In-The-Middle

#### Brief

This scenario combines the previous two in that the users start at different locations but unite at some point in the middle before proceeding to the same destination, combning the needs of both previous scenarios.

#### Discussion

The primary need of this scenario is for the process of meeting in the middle to be smoothe. The users would prefer to minimise waiting times and meet at a location that is easy to find each other in and perhaps has amenities if the wait time will be long. This meet plan will need to be flexible in response to any issues that might arise on the journey to the meeting point such as traffic or mechanical issues.

## Secondary Scenarios

### Same Start Location But Disconnected

#### Brief

In this Scenario the users start from the same location but might leave at different times and do not necessarily want to stick together.

### Follow the Leader

#### Brief

In this scenario one user is considered to have expertise either in driving or the routes. and so they are assigned to lead the convoy. They should be ahead of the other drivers and keeping together is more important. It is possible another driver lack confidence for some reason. Perhaps they aren't used to long periods at the wheel, or the route is difficult.

## Overall Discussion of Scenarios

For the Minimum Viable Product it is important to select a scenario to focus on to begin with. I will choose Lone Travel purely because it involves the least complexity and is the most versatile. Users in the other scenarios are most likely be able to use an app designed for the Lone Travel Scenario than an app designed for any of the others.

I think that given the time constraints, the secondary scenarios and the Meet in The Middle Scenario are out of the scope of this project.
