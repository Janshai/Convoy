# Scenarions

## Intro and motivation

I have decided to create scenarios as I think this style of requirements gathering is very suitable to this project. There are three main scenarios that I envision this app being used in as well as a few other more specialised scenarios that the are not the core purpose for the app but are contexts in which users could choose to use the app and so are still worth consideration during the design phases. I will first discuss the main scenarios, then briefly mention the secondary scenarios. I will write 2 descriptions for each scenario, the first a brief quotable description, the second a more in depth discussion of the needs of a user in this use case.

## Core Scenarios

### Lone Travel
#### Brief

The users are each travelling alone from different start-locations to the same destination. They may potentially have different start and arrival times, or wish to synchronise in some way.

#### Discussion

In this scenario the users do not need to communicate or interact in a structured way such as aligning food stops, petrol levels or any other issues that may arise, though it would still be useful to handle these issues within the app to create a single journey experience, these are not hard requirements. The fundamental need is to allow the users to update each other on their progress. Has the other user set off yet? Have they arrived? When will they arrive? Have they broken down? Where are they? It might also be useful to facilitate less structured communication betwen the users such as voice chat. In addition to this the user will expect other features associated with routing apps to be replicated. Some of these may be hard requirements, such as knowing when the user can expect to arrive, adjusting routes based on traffic warnings, communicationg traffic warnings to the user, blow-by-bow instructions e.g. 'Turn right in 50 yards'.


### Joint Journey

#### Brief

The users are travelling from the same location to the same destination at the same time. They want to synchronise their journey, stopping at the same times, so they need a structured way to communicate these decisions without distracting themselves from the road.

#### Discussion

### Meet-In-The-Middle

#### Brief

This scenario combines the previous two in that the users start at different locations but unite at some point in the middle before proceeding to the same destination, combning the needs of both previous scenarios.
